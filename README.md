# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a modern, responsive web application for tracking and managing daily employee tasks. It features a Kanban-style board, task creation/editing, real-time time tracking, and an AI-powered suite of tools using the Google Gemini API to optimize your workflow.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡️ Core Productivity
- **Dual Views**: Visualize your workflow with a classic Kanban Board or a monthly Calendar View.
- **Time Tracking**: Built-in start/stop timers on every task. Track duration and view detailed session history logs.
- **Subtasks & Checklists**: Break complex tasks into actionable steps. Use AI to automatically generate checklist items based on the task description.
- **Smart Tagging**: Organize tasks with custom, color-coded tags. Includes an intelligent autocomplete system for quick tagging.
- **Task Dependencies**: Create "blocking" relationships between tasks to ensure work is completed in the correct order.
- **Real-time Database**: Powered by Supabase for instant updates and team collaboration.

### 🤖 AI Integration (Powered by Gemini)
- **Goal-to-Task Generation**: Describe a high-level objective, and Gemini will generate a complete list of assigned tasks to achieve it.
- **Smart Subtask Creation**: Automatically generate a checklist of subtasks for any specific task with one click.
- **Priority Suggestion**: AI analyzes task content to suggest appropriate priority levels (Low to Urgent).
- **Weekly Summaries**: Generate concise, natural-language status reports and summaries for the admin dashboard.
- **AI Assistant**: Context-aware chat to ask questions or get advice about specific tasks.

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Modern UI/UX**: A polished, split-screen login page with responsive design and smooth transitions.
